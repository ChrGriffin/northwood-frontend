        <h2>About Northwood</h2>
        <p>Northwood is a one-man operation out of Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. I began experimenting and learning with
            woodworking in the Spring of 2019, and fell in the love with the work swiftly thereafter. I was - and still
            am - eager to expore all facets of the craft, but have found myself drawn to a modern style consisting of
            clean lines, sharp angles, simple shapes, and natural wood tones.</p>
        <p>My days are occupied web development. Woodworking remains a side-hobby, which allows me to focus exclusively
            on projects that I am excited about doing. I do my work at
            <a href="https://www.kwartzlab.ca/" target="_blank">Kwartzlab</a>, a makerspace in Kitchener-Waterloo that I
            highly recommend to anyone in the area.</p>
